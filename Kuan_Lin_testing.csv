A topological quantum computer encodes information in the configurations of different braids. The computer physically weaves braids in the 2D+1 space-time of the lattice, and uses this braiding to carry out calculations. A pair of quasi-particles, such as non-abelian anyons, can be moved around each other in a braid-like path. The quasi-particles can be moved as a result of a magnetic or optical field being applied to them, for example. When the pair of quasi-particles are brought together, they may annihilate each other or create a new anyon. A result is that an anyon may be present or not, which can be thought of as a “one” or “zero,” respectively. Such ones and zeros can be interpreted to provide information.",Methods of Building Qubits,0.9978524446

Results show that the energy gap of a semiconducting nanotube can be narrowed when the nanotube is placed in an electric field perpendicular to the tube axis. Such effect in turn causes changes in electrical conductivity and radiation absorption characteristics that can be used in applications such as switches, transistors, photodetectors and polaron generation. By applying electric fields across the nanotube at a number of locations, a corresponding number of quantum wells are formed adjacent to one another. Such configuration is useful for Bragg reflectors, lasers and quantum computing.",Methods of Building Qubits,0.9884049892

Explicit recursive algorithms are provided for computing the hard pulse from the inverse scattering data. These algorithms are essentially discretizations of the Marchenko equations. When bound states are present, both the left and right Marchenko equations are used in order to improve the numerical stability of the algorithm.
